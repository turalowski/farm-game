# Brief information

Shout out to [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisCourses) who is teaching game dev with JavaScript.

This game is developed by using his video + materials. You can access to exact course from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA&ab_channel=ChrisCourses)

I inspired by him and decided to develop the same game by using React + functional approach.
